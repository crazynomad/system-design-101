# Why is Kafka fast

There are many design decisions that contributed to Kafka’s performance. In this post, we’ll focus on two. We think these two carried the most weight.<p>

The first one is Kafka’s reliance on Sequential I/O.The second design choice that gives Kafka its performance advantage is its focus on efficiency: zero copy principle.The diagram illustrates how the data is transmitted between producer and consumer, and what zero-copy means.Step 1.1 - 1.3: Producer writes data to the diskStep 2: Consumer reads data without zero-copy2.1 The data is loaded from disk to OS cache2.2 The data is copied from OS cache to Kafka application2.3 Kafka application copies the data into the socket buffer2.4 The data is copied from socket buffer to network card2.5 The network card sends data out to the consumerStep 3: Consumer reads data with zero-copy3.1: The data is loaded from disk to OS cache
3.2 OS cache directly copies the data to the network card via sendfile() command
3.3 The network card sends data out to the consumerZero copy is a shortcut to save the multiple data copies between application context and kernel context.
