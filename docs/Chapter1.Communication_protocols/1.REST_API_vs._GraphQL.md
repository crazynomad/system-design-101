## REST API vs. GraphQL
REST API vs. GraphQLWhen it comes to API design, REST and GraphQL each have their own strengths and weaknesses.The diagram below shows a quick comparison between REST and GraphQL.<p>

RESTUses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations.Works well when you need simple, uniform interfaces between separate services/applications.Caching strategies are straightforward to implement.The downside is it may require multiple roundtrips to assemble related data from separate endpoints.GraphQLProvides a single endpoint for clients to query for precisely the data they need.Clients specify the exact fields required in nested queries, and the server returns optimized payloads containing just those fields.Supports Mutations for modifying data and Subscriptions for real-time notifications.Great for aggregating data from multiple sources and works well with rapidly evolving frontend requirements.However, it shifts complexity to the client side and can allow abusive queries if not properly safeguardedCaching strategies can be more complicated than REST.The best choice between REST and GraphQL depends on the specific requirements of the application and development team. GraphQL is a good fit for complex or frequently changing frontend needs, while REST suits applications where simple and consistent contracts are preferred.Neither API approach is a silver bullet. Carefully evaluating requirements and tradeoffs is important to pick the right style. Both REST and GraphQL are valid options for exposing data and powering modern applications.
