PaginationThis is a common optimization when the size of the result is large. The results are streaming back to the client to improve the service responsiveness.Asynchronous LoggingSynchronous logging deals with the disk for every call and can slow down the system. Asynchronous logging sends logs to a lock-free buffer first and immediately returns. The logs will be flushed to the disk periodically. This significantly reduces the I/O overhead.CachingWe can store frequently accessed data into a cache. The client can query the cache first instead of visiting the database directly. If there is a cache miss, the client can query from the database. Caches like Redis store data in memory, so the data access is much faster than the database.Payload CompressionThe requests and responses can be compressed using gzip etc so that the transmitted data size is much smaller. This speeds up the upload and download.Connection PoolWhen accessing resources, we often need to load data from the database. Opening the closing db connections adds significant overhead. So we should connect to the db via a pool of open connections. The connection pool is responsible for managing the connection lifecycle.
