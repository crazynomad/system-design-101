# 8 Data Structures That Power Your Databases

The answer will vary depending on your use case. Data can be indexed in memory or on disk. Similarly, data formats vary, such as numbers, strings, geographic coordinates, etc. The system might be write-heavy or read-heavy. All of these factors affect your choice of database index format.<p>

The following are some of the most popular data structures used for indexing data:Skiplist: a common in-memory index type. Used in RedisHash index: a very common implementation of the “Map” data structure (or “Collection”)SSTable: immutable on-disk “Map” implementationLSM tree: Skiplist + SSTable. High write throughputB-tree: disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performanceInverted index: used for document indexing. Used in LuceneSuffix tree: for string pattern searchR-tree: multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor
