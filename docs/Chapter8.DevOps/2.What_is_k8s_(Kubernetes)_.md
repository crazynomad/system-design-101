A k8s cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers, and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance and high availability.Control Plane ComponentsAPI ServerThe API server talks to all the components in the k8s cluster. All the operations on pods are executed by talking to the API server.SchedulerThe scheduler watches pod workloads and assigns loads on newly created pods.Controller ManagerThe controller manager runs the controllers, including Node Controller, Job Controller, EndpointSlice Controller, and ServiceAccount Controller.Etcdetcd is a key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.NodesPodsA pod is a group of containers and is the smallest unit that k8s administers. Pods have a single IP address applied to every container within the pod.KubeletAn agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures containers are running in a Pod.Kube ProxyKube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster. It routes traffic coming into a node from the service. It forwards requests for work to the correct containers.
