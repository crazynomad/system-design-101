# How does Docker work?

The diagram below shows the architecture of Docker and how it works when we run “docker build”, “docker pull” 
and “docker run”.<p>

There are 3 components in Docker architecture:Docker clientThe docker client talks to the Docker daemon.Docker hostThe Docker daemon listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.Docker registryA Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use.Let’s take the “docker run” command as an example.Docker pulls the image from the registry.Docker creates a new container.Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container.Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network.Docker starts the container.
